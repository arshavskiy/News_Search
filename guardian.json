It was the strangest thing I had ever seen.” </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/27/atomic-bomb-north-carolina-video\">US atomic bomb detonation was avoided by 'the slightest margin of chance'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He came out of the water, excitedly describing the bowl-shaped object and its bolts that were bigger than basketballs. “I started telling my crew: ‘My God, I found a UFO.’” He sketched a rough outline of what he had seen on a napkin. </p> <p>Smyrichinsky started asking around, curious if anyone else had ever come across the mysterious object. “Nobody had ever seen it before or heard of it. Nobody ever dives there,” <a href=\"http://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/canadian-army-interested-in-old-nuke-that-may-have-been-found-off-haida-gwaii\">he told the Vancouver Sun</a>. “Then some old-timer said: ‘Oh, you might have found that bomb.’”</p> <p>It was a reference to the Mark IV, a 10-foot, blimp-shaped nuclear bomb weighing some five tonnes and which went missing over the Pacific during a US air force B-36 training flight on 13 February 1950. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.royalaviationmuseum.com/2171/broken-arrow-the-lost-nuke-of-1950/\">According to the Royal Aviation Museum of Western Canada</a>, the intercontinental bomber had left an air base in Alaska for a mission that included a simulated drop on San Francisco when three of the plane’s six engines caught fire. </p> <p>The crew was forced to abandon the bomber but US air force reports said they first jettisoned the bomb over the Pacific. The US military said the lost bomb was a dummy capsule – packed with lead rather than the plutonium core needed for an atomic explosion.</p> <p>The bomber disappeared from the radar screen just before midnight. Days later, 12 of the 17 men onboard were found alive. The plane, set to autopilot by the crew before they parachuted out of the aircraft, <a href=\"http://www.mythmerchantfilms.com/index.php/mnu2-lib-lostnuke\">crashed into the snow-covered mountains of northern British Columbia</a>. </p> <p>The parallels between what he had seen and the story of the lost nuke sent Smyrichinsky searching online. “And sure enough, there was a story about this lost bomb,” he told CBC. </p> <p>An image turned up a photo resembling what he had seen. “A big circle with these balls, I had no idea that particular bomb contained all these big balls, bigger than basketballs.” A further search suggested that the balls – each some 20 inches across, he said – were home to the explosive stored in the Mark IV. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/03/canada-forces-investigate-mysterious-pinging-sound-arctic\">Canadian army investigate mysterious 'pinging' sound coming from sea floor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The bomber had crashed some 50 miles south of where he had been diving. “I’m right in the right area and it looks like it could be a piece of that thing,” he said. “What else could it possibly be? I was thinking UFO, but probably not a UFO, right?”</p> <p>Smyrichinsky detailed his find in an email to Canada’s department of national defence, who told him they were looking into the matter with “keen interest”.</p> <p>The Canadian Armed Forces said on Friday that a Canadian navy ship would be deployed in the coming weeks to investigate the object.

Shaded by red and green striped canopies, a couple of hundred people stood in reverential silence around a laptop. On screen, a man with a carefully clipped beard, dressed head-to-toe in white, addressed them via Skype from Japan.</p> <p>The speaker was a spiritual leader known as <a href=\"http://rael.org\" title=\"\">Rael</a>, the founder of one of the world&apos;s largest UFO sects, and he was online to announce the arrival of the first <a href=\"http://www.clitoraid.org/news.php?extend.154\" title=\"\">clitoral repair hospital in Africa</a>.</p> <p>Rael preaches that humans were created by extraterrestrials to enjoy untrammelled sexual pleasure – a belief that has led the group to campaign against female genital mutilation (FGM), <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/aug/25/surgery-for-female-genital-mutilation\" title=\"\">and to advocate surgery to improve sexual feeling to FGM victims</a>.</p> <p>&quot;The idea of the hospital came from Rael,&quot; said Nadine Gary, a spokeswoman for <a href=\"http://www.clitoraid.org/\" title=\"\">Clitoraid</a>, the Raelian-backed NGO behind the clinic. &quot;Rael realised a lot of campaigning work is being done to prevent circumcision, but nothing is being done for the women who have already been circumcised.&quot;</p> <p>Each year about 3 million girls – mostly in rural Africa and Asia, are forced to have part of their genitalia sliced off. But while clitoral reconstruction surgery is becoming more common in the west, it remains contested. The procedure restores normal appearances to women who have been mutilated – which can be an important step in restoring self-image – but some doctors argue it risks causing further damage.</p> <p>Several hundred women have approached Clitoraid to undergo the free surgery in Bobo-Dioulasso. Among the first was Marcelina, 33, who had been mutilated at the age of 13 by a traditional &quot;cutter&quot;, using a blunt blade and no anaesthetic. &quot;I&apos;m really happy about this hospital. FGM is just a way to oppress women. We have a right to enjoy full sexual pleasure,&quot; she said after the operation.</p> <p>But Clitoraid&apos;s attempt to launch its clinic in Burkina Faso has had a wary response from local officials, and furious opposition from mainstream religious leaders in the country. Critics warn of a long history of doomed humanitarian interventions in Africa that failed to take account of local culture.</p> <p>So how did an American UFO cult end up spending almost a decade attempting to build a clinic in a landlocked west African nation few outsiders can locate on a map? It is a tale that has seen an unlikely alliance between a California-based fringe group and the growing number of African women speaking out against a painful tradition.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-432581364\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/19/1395236181372/Rael-008.jpg\" alt=\"Rael\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rael, the spiritual leader of the international Raelian movement.

As well as slicing off the clitoris, the vagina was sewn up, leaving just a small hole to allow urination. The opening was enlarged after marriage.</p> \n<p>In 1996, the sprawling desert country launched one of Africa&apos;s most successful campaigns to end the devastating practice. Years of dogged work by teams of community health workers helped change attitudes at ground level, and by 2011 the UN found that fewer than a fifth of under-10s had been cut, compared with 80% of those between 20 and 49.</p> \n<p>In this environment, Clitoraid began building its hospital in Burkina Faso&apos;s second city of Bobo-Dioulasso eight years ago. Abibata Sanon, the group&apos;s local co-ordinator – who had had reconstructive surgery at a private clinic in Ouagadougou – claimed dozens of women approached her about surgery. &quot;Even men were calling to make inquiries on behalf of their wives. I always tell them I&apos;ve [had the operation] – it changed my life,&quot; she said.</p>"}},{"type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/19/1395236042008/The-Raelians-clitoral-rep-009.jpg","typeData":{"width":460,"height":276}}],"imageTypeData":{"caption":"The Raelians' clitoral repair hospital in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso.

Clitoraid was forced to rename the hospital after local people complained that its original name – &quot;the House of Pleasure&quot; – was inappropriate. Dishing out free sex toys in the conservative society backfired, and many bristled at the group&apos;s fundraising efforts in the west, from collecting donations at adult entertainment venues, to a short-lived <a href=\"http://savingafrica.wordpress.com/clitoraid/\" title=\"\">campaign called &quot;Adopt a Clitoris&quot;.</a><br />Clitoraid&apos;s spokeswoman dismisses such criticism. &quot;No other religion dares touch the issue of women&apos;s sexuality,&quot; said Gary. &quot;We&apos;re not asking these women what their religion is – this is a humanitarian mission. All they want is their clitoris back.&quot;</p> \n<p>Yet some doctors say there&apos;s no evidence that this is possible. Critics say it is like to trying to build a hand from an amputated wrist – and more research needs to be done before the technique becomes widespread.</p> \n<p>In June 2012, a team led by the French urologist and surgeon Pierre Foldès published <a href=\"http://press.thelancet.com/FGM.pdf\" title=\"\">an article in the Lancet [PDF]</a>, in which he described a technique whereby clitoral sensation could be restored in an operation that takes less than an hour.</p> \n<p>Foldès profiled 866 of the 2,938 patients he had operated on. A year later, 821 reported a decrease in pain and 430 experienced their first orgasms. Many had turned up after seeing the effects on their own family members. While admitting surgery was only the initial step to recovery for mutilated women, <a href=\"http://world.time.com/2012/09/20/can-female-genital-mutilation-be-surgically-undone/\" title=\"\">Foldès declared his technique a success</a>. But his conclusions are not universally accepted. Some doctors say there is insufficient evidence – Foldès&apos; results were based on a small sample, tested with a self-devised scale of pleasure and pain. Critics argue that more research needs to be done before the technique becomes widespread.</p> \n<p>A team of experts from University College hospital in London led by Professor Sarah Creighton published a response in the Lancet. &quot;The campaign against FGM could be undermined by a false proposition that the ill effects can be reversed. Formation of a &apos;neoglans&apos; cannot restore the lost or damaged innervation,&quot; the letter said. &quot;We&apos;re not saying don&apos;t think about ways to help women who have already suffered terrible harm, but be honest about what you&apos;re doing: [clitoral reconstruction] is cosmetic surgery,&quot; said one doctor – who admitted the procedure could still help some women by bolstering their self-image.</p> \n<p>Ram Zongo, a 42-year-old businesswoman from Ivory Coast, said she underwent the procedure in Burkina Faso&apos;s capital, Ouagadougou, because fashions were changing, and African men no longer wanted women who had been &quot;excised&quot;. &quot;So far there hasn&apos;t been any difference, but the doctors warned it&apos;s not every case where sensation is restored,&quot; she said.</p> \n<p>Further wrangling over a licence means the hospital has still not officially opened, but Clitoraid says it has successfully operated on dozens of women in another local clinic.</p> \n<p>Among those cheering when Rael gave his speech were members of Burkina Faso&apos;s small but flourishing Raelian community. Souba, a chatty, unemployed man who had brought his wife with him, said he saw no reason why Raelianism couldn&apos;t be accommodated alongside Sufi Islam or Catholicism, the religions that dominate Burkina Faso. &quot;Whether it&apos;s by the grace of God, or the grace of Rael, it doesn&apos;t matter. This is a continent that needs as many hospitals as possible,&quot; he said.</p> \n<p>But local officials are concerned that vulnerable women could be pressured into joining the Raelians. &quot;The operations they want to perform are a good thing. But it isn&apos;t right to use medical issues as a cover to convert vulnerable people,&quot; René Segbo, the country&apos;s health ministry spokesperson, said.</p> \n<p>He said the group had failed to complete the appropriate paperwork and that doubts remained over its outpatient care. &quot;As far as I&apos;m concerned, they shouldn&apos;t be operating,&quot; he said.</p> \n<p><em>Additional reporting by Katie Mark and Julia Mills in Bobo-Dioulassou</em></p>"}}]}],"totalBodyBlocks":1},"isHosted":false},{"id":"world/2016/sep/17/hungary-migration-poll-divides-nation-viktor-orban","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2016-09-17T20:20:04Z","webTitle":"‘They’ve brought evil out’: Hungary’s poll on migration divides a nation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/17/hungary-migration-poll-divides-nation-viktor-orban","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2016/sep/17/hungary-migration-poll-divides-nation-viktor-orban","fields":{"body":"<p>The Hungarian government’s map of Europe is dotted with stark warnings of “no-go zones” it claims are patrolled by violent immigrants, six in the UK clustered around London alone.</p> <p>The poisonous graphic, in a leaflet handed out to voters ahead of a controversial referendum on refugees, pays no heed to facts or geography but its message is clear.

The poisonous graphic, in a leaflet handed out to voters ahead of a controversial referendum on refugees, pays no heed to facts or geography but its message is clear. It forms part of an expensive and expansive campaign by authorities in Budapest that is whipping up xenophobic sentiment at home, and sowing tension far beyond Hungarian borders. The ballot, conceived and championed by prime minister Viktor Orbán, is ostensibly about whether parliament should allow the European Union to set a quota for refugee resettlement within the country. But critics contend that he is using groundless fear to bolster his position at home and shore up a challenge to Europe. They point out that the ballot comes as Europe is backing away from the mandatory quota system that officially inspired the campaign: there are just a few thousand refugees in Hungary today, and that number is unlikely to rise. Syrians, Afghans and others crossing into Europe are not drawn by dreams of a Hungarian future. “One has the suspicion that this referendum is not about the refugees, that it is rather about the manipulation of the voters, and some kind of strengthening of positions within the EU,” said pastor Gábor Iványi, a one-time ally in the anti-Communist movement who baptised two of Orbán’s children. “Hungary is not a target country in this refugee crisis.” A campaign that is already spreading hate at home risks having serious fallout for Europe as well, further fracturing leaders already split over everything from the refugee crisis to the euro’s woes, and potentially consolidating Orbán’s efforts to challenge the status quo with a bloc of other eastern nations. The language has been so violent that it fuelled demands from one European leader that Hungary be expelled from the union for stirring up hatred. Even stalwart supporters of Orbán’s initiative often admit they have had no interaction, much less trouble, with outsiders. “I’ve only met foreigners who are tourists and not had any problems,” said cheery retiree László Czeto, 87, firmly committed to supporting the government. “I just don’t want a lot of people to come to Hungary. I think they are not real refugees.” Yet there are clear political advantages to focusing on refugees – a target largely absent and unable to respond – at a time when Hungary is grappling with concerns from rampant graft to failing public services, critics say.\nA recent survey found that four in five young Hungarians think the state is riddled with corruption, and more than half have encountered it themselves. The country comes 50th in Transparency International’s ranking of corruption worldwide, and the state has been taking power away from anti-corruption bodies. “They don’t want people to speak about problems like corruption, and healthcare, they want people to talk about the nonexistent migrants,” said Gergely Kovács of activist group Two-Tailed Dog, a party originally launched as political satire that put pooches up as candidates, with manifestos promising free beer and eternal life to mock empty promises. But as the political landscape in Hungary grew bleaker, its founders were forced to become more serious, although humour is still used as their main weapon. “I’ve never seen so much hate in this country before,” said Kovács. “They have brought evil out and that’s why we felt we should do something.” A crowdfunded advertising campaign uses ridicule and well-chosen statistics to show up government fear-mongering. A poster warning that a million people in Libya want to come to Europe is matched by one reminding voters that a million Hungarians want to go to Europe; others warn of “dangers” ranging from the risk of drinking water spiked with LSD to medieval bear attacks. There is also a more serious campaign to persuade voters to spoil their ballots, perhaps the only way to fight back against Orbán because, in a country with a long history of unease with migrants and extensive government influence over the media, he is guaranteed an overwhelming majority. The only way that victory will be undermined is if turnout fails to meet the relatively high threshold needed for it to be legally binding. A history of voter apathy may be one reason for the aggressive campaign, opponents speculate. The government denies allegations of racism, and says the campaign is strictly factual. Yet it struggles to defend many of its claims, among them the “no-go zone” allegations which have echoes of claims made about Paris by US news channel Fox. Questioned about the map, government spokesman Zoltán Kovács claimed it was based on public statistics, but could not provide them to the Guardian and admitted it was deceptive. “It relates to London. The picture is a bit disproportionate,” he said, when asked about which areas were covered by the warning signs on the UK, sprinkled roughly from Peterborough to Southampton. He went on to cite riots in London’s south-east in 2011, before the Syrian war had begun in earnest, much less the refugee crisis it has sparked. And the campaign is already spreading poison across the country, said Demeter Áron from Amnesty international, who leads a group of charities monitoring hate crime. “One young boy, 14, from the poorest part of the country said ‘migrant’ had already become the playground insult of choice, replacing anti-gay and anti-Roma slurs,” he said. And it has made many of Hungary’s small minority population even more uncomfortable, both on the streets and in a society they already felt was ambivalent. “I don’t want to pay tax so people throw a referendum against me,” said Iranian refugee Behruz, 31, who has lived in Hungary for the past five years. “You are serving a society that is arming against you.” Immigration offers more opportunity to Hungary than its government will admit, because it has developed a labour crisis more or less in parallel with Europe’s refugee crisis. With hundreds of thousands of young people heading west, there is a huge shortage of workers. András Kováts, of charity Menedék, which has been working with refugees for more than 20 years, says that for the first time there are no problems finding jobs for new arrivals. “This is not about moral obligations, businesses need workers.” But immigration sits at the heart of Orbán’s challenge to Europe, and so economic growth is not a priority. “We don’t want to fill [jobs] with migration from other cultures,” Kovács added. Orbán has emerged as the most high-profile leader in a group of eastern European countries known as the Visegrád four – Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. They have a combined population equivalent to that of the UK and are increasingly vocal about their frustration with the status quo. In the continent’s current struggles with Brexit and the refugee and economic crises, Orbán has seen particular opportunity, talking openly this summer of an eastward shift in Europe’s centre of gravity. “If there is such a thing as an ‘old Europe’, it is here,” he told a student conference. “If we talk about how we envisage the capital of Europe, Budapest comes to mind more often than Brussels does.” Perhaps one reason that seems plausible is Orbán’s own dramatic political transformation, a full 180-degree turnaround from when he was a firebrand liberal opponent of communism and critic of Moscow, to a man whose economic and political project aligns closely with Russian president Vladimir Putin. “I think he is pretty much aware of the fact that this referendum can contribute to the destabilisation of the EU when it is not in a good state and he knows that Putin will be grateful for that,” said Péter Krekó, an analyst with Hungarian thinktank Political Capital.

Vucetich said the office had responded to increased sightings of natural and artificial phenomena, from meteorites to \"space junk\" in Peru. \"When you present evidence of UFOs, people can react with terror or hysteria, so we have to be very careful how we present it,\" he stressed. UFO sightings are not uncommon in Peru. Two weeks ago, local media reported that villagers in Marabamba, in Peru's central Huanuco region, watched luminous balls of light in the sky over several days. Numerous reported sightings of UFOs have been made in Chilca, a beach resort 59km south of Lima. The unexplained sightings have attracted UFO investigators from around the world. One former resident, Paulina Jimenez, 82, told the Guardian how 16 years ago she saw \"a huge number of flashing lights\" over a bluff overlooking the resort's Yaya beach, the most regular location for UFO sightings among local residents. \"There are various locations in Peru where there are regular sightings. What's bad is that those reports have never been proven so I can't, on behalf of the air force, verify those,\" Vucetich said. He added that he, too, had seen what he could only describe as \"anomalous aerial phenomena\". \"On a personal basis, it's evident to me that we are not alone in this world or universe.\" The UFO office has a telephone hotline, an email address (dinae@fap.mil.pe) and a website for reports of UFO sightings. The revival of the UFO office will allow Peru to compare and share information with similar agencies in Uruguay, Chile, Brazil, Ecuador and Argentina. Last week, Antonio Huneeus, a Chilean UFO investigator, told Open Minds UFO Radio that the Peruvian move responded to greater interest in such phenomena in the region. \"There are a few cultural reasons too, the public is more open-minded about the phenomenon of UFOs,\" he added.","attributes":{},"published":true,"createdDate":"2016-01-16T01:27:31Z","lastModifiedDate":"2016-01-16T01:27:31Z","contributors":[],"elements":[{"type":"text","assets":[],"textTypeData":{"html":"<p>Peru&apos;s air force is reopening an office responsible for investigating UFOs due to &quot;increased sightings of anomalous aerial phenomena&quot; in the country&apos;s skies.</p> \n<p>The Department of Investigation of Anomalous Aerial Phenomena (DIFAA), first created in 2001, is being revived after lying formant for five years because more UFO sightings have been reported to the media, said Colonel Julio Vucetich, head of the air force&apos;s <a href=\"http://www.dinae.fap.mil.pe/\" title=\"\">aerospace interests division</a>.</p> \n<p>The unit will bring together sociologists, archaeologists, astronomers, meteorologists and air force personnel to analyse these events, Vucetich told the Guardian. &quot;Many people don&apos;t report UFO sightings because they fear they will be labelled mad or made fun of, but nowadays with new technology – cellphone videos, Facebook, Twitter – they can be much more open, without feeling that they are the only ones who have seen what they&apos;ve seen,&quot; he said.</p> \n<p>&quot;This new office needs those people to come and report their sightings so we can open a file and, using their information, do the respective analysis and investigation,&quot; he added, flicking through a hefty scrapbook of newspaper cuttings recording Peruvian UFO sightings dating from 1950 to the present day.

In 2011, the White House responded to a petition on the subject by formally denying any such cover-up. \"There is no evidence that any life exists outside our planet, or that an extraterrestrial presence has contacted or engaged any member of the human race,\" the White House response said. \"In addition, there is no credible information to suggest that any evidence is being hidden from the public's eye.\" But that official intervention has only served to stoke anger among those who believe in a vast government conspiracy. More than 10,000 separate UFO sightings are reported each year to two leading conspiracy websites, according to one witness, Richard Dolan, who has written several books on the subject. Linda Moulton Howe, a former documentary filmmaker, said that aliens had been visiting earth \"since before the dinosaurs\". \"We are dealing with technology so advanced that they can bend space and time,\" she said, to loud applause.

UFO watchers from around the world were patched in via live video link and booths of simultaneous translators provided coverage in Spanish, Arabic, Hindi, Japanese and Mandarin. Even the Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan paid a visit, complete with a dozen security guards.</p> \n<p>Not one of those who spoke during an opening session filled with around 100 delegates disputed the premise that extraterrestrial visits were being hidden from the public.</p> \n<p>In 2011, the White House responded to a petition on the subject by <a href=\"https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/response/searching-et-no-evidence-yet\">formally denying any such cover-up</a>. &quot;There is no evidence that any life exists outside our planet, or that an extraterrestrial presence has contacted or engaged any member of the human race,&quot; the White House response said. &quot;In addition, there is no credible information to suggest that any evidence is being hidden from the public&apos;s eye.&quot;</p> \n<p>But that official intervention has only served to stoke anger among those who believe in a vast government conspiracy.</p> \n<p>More than 10,000 separate UFO sightings are reported each year to <a href=\"http://www.nuforc.org/\">two leading</a> <a href=\"http://ufonetwork.org/\">conspiracy websites</a>, according to one witness, Richard Dolan, who has written several books on the subject. Linda Moulton Howe, a former documentary filmmaker, said that aliens had been visiting earth &quot;since before the dinosaurs&quot;. &quot;We are dealing with technology so advanced that they can bend space and time,&quot; she said, to loud applause.</p> \n<p>The politicians who made up the committee were given just five minutes each to cross-examine witnesses, but defended their presence and the $20,000 &quot;honorarium&quot;.</p> \n<p>&quot;I would not have come if I thought it was damaging to my reputation,&quot; said California Democrat Lynn Woolsey, who retired from Congress this year after 10 terms in office. &quot;I am here because I believe in transparency.&quot;</p> \n<p>Roscoe Bartlett, a Tea Party Republican from Maryland who served 10 terms in Congress and chaired a sub-committee of the House armed services committtee, said: &quot;Extraterrestrials are not anti-biblical. Read the book of Job – it&apos;s all there.&quot; </p> \n<p>Senator Mike Gravel, a Democrat who represented Alaska for 22 years, added: &quot;It is the height of human arrogance to think that we are the only sentient humans [sic] in the universe that can think.&quot;</p> \n<p>Witnesses gave a variety of reasons for the persistence of the cover-up, even after the end of the Cold War.

Area 51, the secret government space in the Mojave desert, was used to test aerial programs. While government officials have mentioned the base in passing over the years, a newly declassified history provides the first official acknowledgement that Area 51 exists and provides new details on what the space has been used for – and it is not what conspiracy theorists want to hear. According to the seven-chapter history, Area 51 was used as an aerial testing ground for US government projects. The released documents specifically refer to the U-2 and Oxcart aerial surveillance programs. \"High-altitude testing of the U-2 soon led to an unexpected side effect – a tremendous increase in reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs),\" according to the documents, which became public through a Freedom of Information Act request submitted by George Washington University's National Security Archive. The documents, first published in 1992 and posted online on Thursday, attributed these UFO \"sightings\" to the U-2s ability to fly above 60,000ft – which was considered too high for manned flight by the general public at the time. \"U-2 and later Oxcart flights accounted for more than one-half of all UFO reports during the late 1950s and most of the 1960s,\" according to the documents.

Area 51's location has also been easy to find with a quick internet search, but a map in the documents confirms that the longtime center of government-alien conspiracy theories is located in the Mojave desert, about 100 miles outside Las Vegas, Nevada.

This is Martin Farrer with the top stories this morning.</p> <p>A committee of MPs has found that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/12/foreign-states-may-have-interfered-in-brexit-vote-report-says\">foreign governments such as Russia and China could have interfered with the Brexit referendum </a>last June. Concern focuses on the collapse of the government’s voter registration website on 7 June, raising the possibility that thousands of people were disenfranchised. The MPs say there is evidence that the crash was caused by distributed denial of service attack (DDOS) using botnets – a network of computers infected with malicious software. It follows months of speculation about the possible role of the Kremlin in the US elections. </p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Syria strains – </strong>Still with Russia (sort of), and the big news today will be how Rex Tillerson fares on his first visit to Moscow since becoming Donald Trump’s secretary of state. Our man in Moscow, Alec Luhn, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/12/rex-tillerson-russia-moscow-trip-syria-attack\">explains why he might get a frosty reception</a> and is unlikely to meet Putin as the Kremlin strongman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/11/g7-rejects-uk-call-for-sanctions-against-russia-and-syria\">hardens his stance on Syria.</a> </p> <p>Meanwhile, accident-prone Sean Spicer is in trouble after trying to defend the Syria airstrikes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/11/sean-spicer-hitler-chemical-weapons-holocaust-assads\">claiming that “even Hitler didn’t use chemical weapons”</a>. And Trump faced the first proper electoral test of his leadership so far – albeit indirectly – with a congressional election in the heartland state of Kansas.

Defender Marc Bartra was injured in the blasts which police have been at pains so far not to describe as a terror attack.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>A doomed love</strong> – Letters written by Sylvia Plath are understood to detail how her husband, the poet laureate Ted Hughes, beat her two days before she had a miscarriage and that he wanted her dead. The<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/11/unseen-sylvia-plath-letters-claim-domestic-abuse-by-ted-hughes\"> revelations about the couple’s marriage</a> come in unseen letters from the American poet to her therapist in the early 1960s. They are part of an archive of material put up for sale by an antiquarian bookseller.<br /></p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Brand blow – </strong>It will be illegal to sell branded cigarettes from next month after the supreme court <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/apr/11/uk-supreme-court-denies-tobacco-firms-permission-for-plain-packaging-appeal\">refused permission for tobacco companies to appeal over standardised packaging </a>legislation. The court’s ruling is final which means that all cigarettes will be sold with standard packets from 20 May, the department of health said. The firms said the rules were unfair because they destroyed their brands.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>No more dog dinners </strong>– The rising popularity of pets has prompted new legislation in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/12/taiwan-bans-dog-and-cat-meat-from-table-as-attitudes-change\">Taiwan banning the slaughter of cats and dogs for human consumption</a>.

The then home secretary Theresa May promised a new era of international cooperation but within a year the inquiry had collapsed.

And the MCC has officially released its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/apr/12/new-gender-neutral-cricket-laws-officially-released-by-mcc\">new laws of cricket</a>, which include gender neutral terminology and alterations to the Mankad rule.</p> <h2>Business</h2> <p>Donald Trump’s “tax holiday” plans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/12/trump-tax-holiday-us-companies-apple-oxfam-tax\">will save the biggest US companies $300bn</a>, according to a new report from Oxfam. Not that it’s done investor morale much good: the markets were flat due to tension over Korea and Syria, with Tokyo shares dropping the most as the safe-haven yen rose.</p> <p>The pound has more or less kept its gains from yesterday at $1.25 and €1.18.</p> <h2>The papers</h2> <p>The <strong>FT</strong>, like the <strong>Guardian</strong>, leads with the claims by Putin that the US may have been duped into believing that the Assad regime had carried out a chemical weapons attack and responding with an airstrike. The <strong>Telegraph</strong> and <strong>Times</strong> are on similar ground, but focus on the G7’s rebuke to Boris Johnson over more sanctions against Russia and Syria.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"473c544677f614b0610e6e808f51fd6635e8ea89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/473c544677f614b0610e6e808f51fd6635e8ea89/0_0_613_944/325.jpg\" alt=\"The Guardian front page Wednesday 12 April.\" width=\"325\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Guardian front page Wednesday 12 April.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The <strong>Mail</strong> and the <strong>Mirror</strong> both lead with the high court ruling that the life support machine of eight-month-old Charlie Gard should be turned off – despite the wishes of his parents.

More people than ever are regularly reading the Guardian, but far fewer are paying for it. Advertising revenues across the media are falling fast. And unlike many news organisations, we haven’t put up a paywall – we want to keep our journalism as open as we can. So we think it’s fair to ask people who read us often for their help. The Guardian’s independent, investigative journalism takes a lot of time, money and hard work to produce. But we do it because we believe our perspective matters – because it might well be your perspective, too.<br /></p> <p>If everyone who reads our reporting, who likes it, helps to support it, our future would be much more secure.

                    "bodyTextSummary": "Top story: MPs warn over hacking of Brexit vote Good morning. This is Martin Farrer with the top stories this morning. A committee of MPs has found that foreign governments such as Russia and China could have interfered with the Brexit referendum last June. Concern focuses on the collapse of the government’s voter registration website on 7 June, raising the possibility that thousands of people were disenfranchised. The MPs say there is evidence that the crash was caused by distributed denial of service attack (DDOS) using botnets – a network of computers infected with malicious software. It follows months of speculation about the possible role of the Kremlin in the US elections. * * * Syria strains – Still with Russia (sort of), and the big news today will be how Rex Tillerson fares on his first visit to Moscow since becoming Donald Trump’s secretary of state. Our man in Moscow, Alec Luhn, explains why he might get a frosty reception and is unlikely to meet Putin as the Kremlin strongman hardens his stance on Syria.

Putin predicted such fake attacks would be used to justify further US missile strikes on the regime, like the attack on Shayrat air force base on Friday.</p> <p>Senior White House officials said that Syrian military officers involved in the regime’s chemical weapons programme were at the Shayrat base ahead of and on the day of the Khan Sheikhun attack, which they claimed was carried out by a Syrian air force Su-22 warplane, dropping at least one munition containing sarin nerve agent. </p> <p>One official said that there was “no consensus based on the information we have” of direct Russian complicity, but pointed out that the Russian and Syrian military had a long history of close cooperation and that Russian troops were at Shayrat base at the time of the attack.</p> <p>In his remarks Putin said Russia would ask the UN to carry out an investigation into the attack, and accused unnamed western countries of supporting the US strikes in a bid to curry favour with Donald Trump.<br /></p> <p>Before leaving Italy for Moscow, Tillerson had said the government of Assad was “coming to an end”.</p> <p>His trip to Russia was once billed as part of a reset in relations between the two nuclear powers, but is now entirely overshadowed by their growing differences over the Syrian civil war.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/08/explainer-interactive/embed/embed.html?id=656b6c62-40c7-4660-9ab6-83561743f52e\" data-alt=\"G7 explainer\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/08/explainer-interactive/embed/embed.html?id=656b6c62-40c7-4660-9ab6-83561743f52e\">G7 explainer</a> </figure>  <p>Those tensions looked likely to spread to other issues on the eve of Tillerson’s Kremlin meetings. As the secretary of state arrived in Russia, the Trump administration took unambiguous steps to embrace Nato, despite Trump’s derision of it as a candidate. </p> <p>The White House scheduled a press conference for the Nato secretary general with Trump on Wednesday, when Tillerson will meet his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov. More substantively, Trump gave his formal approval to the Senate for Montenegro’s accession to the transatlantic alliance. It was the final American step in raising Montenegro to full membership despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/07/montenegro-nato-us-senate-balkan-states-trump-russia\">Russia’s vocal opposition</a>.</p> <p>“It shows Nato remains an open door, and it’s a good time, with Tillerson going to Moscow, for reiterating that message”, said Sue Brown, a US ambassador to Montenegro during Barack Obama’s administration.</p> <p>“There’s been a lot of speculation and talk about the linkage between the current administration and Russia, and this is an example of the president of the United States saying we’re going to do our own thing.” </p> <p>The Trump administration, which is under formal investigation in the US over its ties to Moscow, has found itself embroiled in a tense diplomatic standoff.<br /></p> <p>During his election campaign, Trump emphasised that after taking power his only focus in Syria would be defeating Islamic State, repeatedly signalling that he had little interest in regime change. Last month his spokesman described Assad’s rule as “political reality”.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/06/the-dead-were-wherever-you-looked-inside-syrian-town-after-chemical-attack\">That policy was upended</a> by the chemical attack on a rebel-held town in northern Syria, which killed nearly 90 people, about a third of them children. Images of the victims caused international outrage and apparently moved Trump to order missile strikes in retaliation.</p> <p>The US has framed those attacks as a specific and contained response to the illegal use of chemical weapons, but it also increased its criticism of Assad and demands for his removal. Tillerson is among those calling for the Syrian president to step down.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2017/apr/11/tillerson-assads-reign-in-syria-is-coming-to-an-end-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/69ekc\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"3376551\"            data-video-name=\"Tillerson: Assad's reign in Syria is coming to an end – video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58ece792e4b05776df18cb01\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2017/04/11/170411Tillerson_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2017/04/11/170411Tillerson.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2017/04/11/170411Tillerson_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2017/apr/11/tillerson-assads-reign-in-syria-is-coming-to-an-end-video\">Tillerson: Assad’s reign in Syria is coming to an end</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>“It is clear to all of us that the reign of the Assad family is coming to an end,” Tillerson told journalists after the G7 summit. “But the question of how that ends and the transition itself could be very important in our view to the durability, the stability inside of a unified Syria.”</p> <p>He said Russia had to choose whether to strengthen its alliance with Iran, the militant group Hezbollah and their client and ally Assad, or use its influence to limit civilian suffering.</p> <p>Soon after, the Russian foreign ministry announced plans for a meeting between Syrian, Iranian and Russian ministers.</p> <p>The British foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/10/boris-johnson-asks-g7-to-consider-fresh-sanctions-against-russia-and-syria\">had led the push for further sanctions</a> on Syrian and Russian leaders. On Tuesday, he said sanctions could still follow the findings of an investigation by the independent Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.</p> <p>“We hope that it may be possible, if we get evidence, that those responsible for unleashing those chemical weapons should be [subject to] sanctions,” he told the BBC, adding that there was widespread support for sanctions if the investigation confirmed Syrian or Russian responsibility.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2017/apr/07/donald-trump-past-comments-syria-assad-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/68q9j\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"3365326\"            data-video-name=\"'Syria is not our problem': Trump's past comments on Assad regime – video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters, PBS, ABC, Twitter/Donald Trump\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58e7effce4b05776df18b9a0\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=12440843&amp;format=video/mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=12440843&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=12440843&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2017/apr/07/donald-trump-past-comments-syria-assad-video\">‘Syria is not our problem’: Trump’s past comments on Assad regime</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Germany and Italy have made clear they feel increasing broad economic restrictions on Russia would be counter-productive, and the Italian foreign minister, Angelino Alfano, said it would be wrong to isolate Russia or push it into a corner.</p> <p>Instead the group should push for political change, after punitive US strikes offered “a window of opportunity to construct a new positive condition for the political process in Syria”, the Italian news agency ANSA reported.</p> <p>Adding to tensions between the US and Russia, a senior US official said on Monday that Washington had reached a preliminary conclusion that Russia knew in advance about the chemical weapons attack, although it had no proof of Moscow’s involvement, the Associated Press reported.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/11/boris-johnson-toothless-theresa-may\">Boris Johnson is largely toothless.

                    "bodyTextSummary": "Vladimir Putin has deepened his support of the Syrian regime, claiming its opponents planned false-flag chemical weapon attacks to justify further US missile strikes. The Russian president’s predictions on Tuesday of an escalation in the Syrian war involving more use of chemical weapons came as US officials provided further details of what they insist was a sarin attack by Bashar al-Assad’s forces against civilians on 4 April, and accused Moscow of a cover-up and possible complicity. The hardening of the Kremlin’s position, and its denial of Assad’s responsibility, accelerated a tailspin in US-Russian relations, just as the US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, arrived in Moscow for direct talks.\nTillerson had hoped to underscore the US position with a unified message from the G7, which condemned the chemical attack at a summit in Italy on Tuesday. However, G7 foreign ministers were divided over possible next steps and refused to back a British call for fresh sanctions. Putin said western and Turkish accusations that Syria’s government dropped the nerve agent that killed dozens of civilians in Idlib earlier this month were comparable to the now-discredited claim that Saddam Hussein had stockpiled weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. “It reminds me of the events in 2003 when US envoys to the security council were demonstrating what they said were chemical weapons found in Iraq,” the president told reporters on Tuesday. “We have seen it all already.” Putin said Russia had information that the US was planning to launch new missile strikes on Syria, and that there were plans to fake chemical attacks there. He insisted that Assad was not behind the alleged sarin attack in Khan Sheikhun, saying Moscow had information “from different sources” that it was carried out by rebel groups intent on dragging the US into the conflict. “We have information that a similar provocation is being prepared … in other parts of Syria, including in the southern Damascus suburbs where they are planning to again plant some substance and accuse the Syrian authorities of using [chemical weapons],” he said, without offering any proof for the assertion. Putin predicted such fake attacks would be used to justify further US missile strikes on the regime, like the attack on Shayrat air force base on Friday. Senior White House officials said that Syrian military officers involved in the regime’s chemical weapons programme were at the Shayrat base ahead of and on the day of the Khan Sheikhun attack, which they claimed was carried out by a Syrian air force Su-22 warplane, dropping at least one munition containing sarin nerve agent. One official said that there was “no consensus based on the information we have” of direct Russian complicity, but pointed out that the Russian and Syrian military had a long history of close cooperation and that Russian troops were at Shayrat base at the time of the attack. In his remarks Putin said Russia would ask the UN to carry out an investigation into the attack, and accused unnamed western countries of supporting the US strikes in a bid to curry favour with Donald Trump. Before leaving Italy for Moscow, Tillerson had said the government of Assad was “coming to an end”. His trip to Russia was once billed as part of a reset in relations between the two nuclear powers, but is now entirely overshadowed by their growing differences over the Syrian civil war.\nThose tensions looked likely to spread to other issues on the eve of Tillerson’s Kremlin meetings. As the secretary of state arrived in Russia, the Trump administration took unambiguous steps to embrace Nato, despite Trump’s derision of it as a candidate.

As the secretary of state arrived in Russia, the Trump administration took unambiguous steps to embrace Nato, despite Trump’s derision of it as a candidate. </p> \n<p>The White House scheduled a press conference for the Nato secretary general with Trump on Wednesday, when Tillerson will meet his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov. More substantively, Trump gave his formal approval to the Senate for Montenegro’s accession to the transatlantic alliance. It was the final American step in raising Montenegro to full membership despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/07/montenegro-nato-us-senate-balkan-states-trump-russia\">Russia’s vocal opposition</a>.</p> \n<p>“It shows Nato remains an open door, and it’s a good time, with Tillerson going to Moscow, for reiterating that message”, said Sue Brown, a US ambassador to Montenegro during Barack Obama’s administration.</p> \n<p>“There’s been a lot of speculation and talk about the linkage between the current administration and Russia, and this is an example of the president of the United States saying we’re going to do our own thing.” </p> \n<p>The Trump administration, which is under formal investigation in the US over its ties to Moscow, has found itself embroiled in a tense diplomatic standoff.<br /></p> \n<p>During his election campaign, Trump emphasised that after taking power his only focus in Syria would be defeating Islamic State, repeatedly signalling that he had little interest in regime change. Last month his spokesman described Assad’s rule as “political reality”.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/06/the-dead-were-wherever-you-looked-inside-syrian-town-after-chemical-attack\">That policy was upended</a> by the chemical attack on a rebel-held town in northern Syria, which killed nearly 90 people, about a third of them children. Images of the victims caused international outrage and apparently moved Trump to order missile strikes in retaliation.</p> \n<p>The US has framed those attacks as a specific and contained response to the illegal use of chemical weapons, but it also increased its criticism of Assad and demands for his removal. Tillerson is among those calling for the Syrian president to step down.</p>"

This is Martin Farrer with the top stories.</p> <p>Boris Johnson will try to persuade his G7 counterparts at talks in Italy today <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/10/boris-johnson-asks-g7-to-consider-fresh-sanctions-against-russia-and-syria\">to consider sanctions against Russia </a>if Vladimir Putin does not abandon Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. It comes as Downing Street revealed last night that Theresa May and Donald Trump had spoken about the Syria situation and agreed that there was a “window of opportunity” to put pressure on Putin.</p> <p>In more high stakes diplomacy, North Korea has denounced the Trump administration’s decision to deploy a naval battle group to the waters off the Korean peninsula, warning that it is<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/11/north-korea-ready-for-war-us-navy-redeploys\"> “ready for war”. </a></p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Medicine breakthrough – </strong>Campaigners are celebrating after the Scottish Medicines Consortium said that a treatment for people exposed to contracting HIV <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/apr/10/people-risk-hiv-scotland-prep-drug-nhs-aids\">would be made free on the NHS</a>. Activists say the ruling will put pressure on the authorities in England to end delays in providing the same medication despite two major court rulings.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>‘A heap of ashes’</strong> – A huge <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/11/blaze-devastates-grand-synthe-migrant-camp-outside-dunkirk\">fire has gutted the Grande-Synthe migrant camp</a> in Dunkirk, leaving at least 10 people injured. The blaze reduced much of the camp to “a heap of ashes”, French authorities said, and followed fights between Afghan and Kurdish people earlier in the day.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Boarding bother – </strong>A passenger has been forcibly removed from an overbooked United Airlines flight in Chicago. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/10/united-airlines-video-passenger-removed-overbooked-flight\">Video posted on social media shows</a> police dragging the screaming man along the aisle of the Louisville-bound plane. United boss Carlos Munoz called the “re-accommodation” of the man “upsetting”. </p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Monk fails the challenge –</strong> The eagerly awaited final of University Challenge <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/apr/10/university-challenge-balliol-dash-hopes-of-monkmania-finale-win\">ended in defeat </a>for Wolfson College, Cambridge, and their unlikely heartthrob star Eric Monkman, losing out to Balliol College, Oxford.

And Sergio García managed to win back the hearts of American fans with his Masters victory, despite his status as a Ryder Cup rival and his tetchy relationship with Tiger Woods, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/apr/10/sergio-garcia-won-back-american-hearts-as-well-as-claiming-the-masters\">writes Ewan Murray</a>.</p> <h2>Business</h2> <p>Air strikes in Syria and gunboat diplomacy off the Korean peninsula are continuing to be bad for business on Asian markets, with stocks down today in Tokyo, Seoul and Hong Kong.

The <strong>Times</strong> says she has backed Donald Trump’s plan to impose more sanctions on Russia unless it moderates its support for Bashar al-Assad. The <strong>Sun</strong>, meanwhile, says that the cabinet is split over further airstrikes with May unwilling to rile Vladimir Putin. “Theresa won’t Putin the boot,” it puns. The <strong>Telegraph</strong> has yet another line, saying that Trump’s son says dad won’t be bullied by Putin.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"07a76fba6e81b0e74c9291933225d2612a8afffc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07a76fba6e81b0e74c9291933225d2612a8afffc/0_0_597_893/334.png\" alt=\"Guardian front page Tuesday 11 April 2017.\" width=\"334\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Guardian’s front page.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The <strong>Guardian</strong> splashes with Scotland leading the way on the HIV drug while the <strong>FT</strong> has more on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/11/barclays-chief-probably-guilty-of-behaving-like-chump\">pay cuts for Barclays chief executive Jes Staley</a> over his pursuit of a whistleblower.

More people than ever are regularly reading the Guardian, but far fewer are paying for it. Advertising revenues across the media are falling fast. And unlike many news organisations, we haven’t put up a paywall – we want to keep our journalism as open as we can. So we think it’s fair to ask people who read us often for their help. The Guardian’s independent, investigative journalism takes a lot of time, money and hard work to produce. But we do it because we believe our perspective matters – because it might well be your perspective, too.<br /></p> <p>If everyone who reads our reporting, who likes it, helps to support it, our future would be much more secure.

A man named AV Tsvetkov uploaded the image alongside others that portrayed Putin and the prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/30/dmitry-medvedev-whipping-boy-russia-discontented-protests\">Dmitry Medvedev</a>, in Nazi uniforms. Court documents say he also shared racist images. The court banned about a dozen of the pictures he uploaded between June 2013 and October 2014. As well as this, his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/17/findface-face-recognition-app-end-public-anonymity-vkontakte\">Vkontakte</a> profile was deleted.</p> \n<p>A quick search of the Russian social media site shows some users are sharing similar images of Putin despite the ban.

Even by Vladimir Putin’s standards, it was a knowing smirk of epic proportions as he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/24/vladimir-putin-hosts-marine-le-pen-in-moscow\">shook hands</a> with Marine Le Pen in the Kremlin on Friday.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/24/vladimir-putin-hosts-marine-le-pen-in-moscow\">Putin tells Le Pen Russia has no plans to meddle in French election</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In his remarks, Putin noted that France was currently involved in an election cycle and that Russia did “not want to influence events in any way”. The sentiment sounded slightly less than genuine given that it came as part of a one-on-one Kremlin meeting with the far-right presidential candidate one month before the vote. </p> <p>The mixed messaging appears to be a deliberate strategy, and is similar to some of the Russian rhetoric around the allegations that the Kremlin intervened to get Donald Trump elected. There is both an outburst of fury at those who would dare to voice such allegations, and a simultaneous revelling in them. </p> <p>Back in December, Putin first said it was absurd to suggest Russia intervened on Trump’s behalf, but immediately <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/dec/23/vladimir-putins-annual-press-conference-live-updates?page=with:block-585cf61be4b0966513aecfc3#block-585cf61be4b0966513aecfc3\">followed up</a> by saying “nobody believed in him, except us”.<br /></p> <p>Le Pen’s surprise visit to the Kremlin was accompanied by similar mood music. The website Life News tweeted an opinion column with the tag “Russia will help Le Pen win” and then deleted the tweet a few minutes later. </p> <p>The news agency Interfax released a snap news item: “The Kremlin announces financing of Marine Le Pen’s election campaign by Russian banks.” Two minutes later there was another snap: “Correction: Kremlin announces it has no information about the financing of Marine Le Pen’s election campaign by Russian banks.”</p> <p>This may well have been a simple slip-up, but the statement and swift retraction fit the pattern of Putin’s wink-nudge denial policy.</p> <p>Whatever the veracity of claims that Russia has financed Le Pen in exchange for policy concessions, or of allegations of Russian links to Trump, the scandals are helping to make a useful political point for the Kremlin at home.</p> <p>“I think by this point Russians probably know the names of the candidates in the French election better than they know the names of their own regional governors,” said political analyst Gleb Pavlovsky, noting the level of coverage on state television. </p> <p>With the Russian economy still struggling, Putin has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/23/siberia-putin-russia-tsar-irkutsk-poverty\">retained support among Russians</a> due to his aggressive foreign policy moves in Ukraine. With a presidential election coming up next year, the image of Putin pulling the strings across the globe is a useful one. <br /></p> <p>While the Kremlin will always formally deny direct meddling, hinting at it helps prop up the idea of Putin as “the most powerful man in the world”, as a recent CNN <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4ad5nUhfCk\">documentary</a> put it.</p> <p>“He represents a sovereign nation ... a new vision ... a new world,” Le Pen said in Moscow shortly after meeting Putin. Expect to see those words featured prominently on Russian news reports.</p>"

And his sympathies for autocratic strongmen such as Vladimir Putin or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/05/hugo-chavez\" title=\"\">Hugo Chávez</a> cannot be easily swept aside, as if these were just missteps in an otherwise promising platform. If you believe that the European project must be salvaged and improved rather than dismantled, Mélenchon really cannot be your man. Not if you look closely.</p> <p>To be sure, he’s having a good run. Unfamiliarity helps. Many outside France – and within it, notably among young people – have only recently discovered him. He’s managed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/27/jean-luc-melenchon-french-presidential-election-hard-left-candidate\" title=\"\">capitalise on some of the rage</a> that animates much of the electorate: he’s apparently even stealing votes from Le Pen. The French are exhausted by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/france+society/unemployment\" title=\"\">decades of high unemployment</a>, they’re deeply distrustful of the political class, and they’re worried about an unpredictable international environment.</p> <p>Mélenchon is a talented orator. His fiery rhetoric in speeches and savvy, quickfire remarks in recent television debates have helped his numbers surge. One of his slogans is “<em>degagisme</em>”, which can translate as “kick them out” – targeting the rest of the political class. He likes to quote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/feb/12/robespierre-revolutionary-peter-mcphee-review\" title=\"\">Maximilien Robespierre</a> and Victor Hugo. He casts himself as a hero of the people (“<em>les gens</em>”), a single, homogeneous entity, set against the establishment. His frequent references to the revolution of 1789, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/picture/2014/jul/31/jean-jaures-socialist-leader-assassinated-first-world-war\" title=\"\">to French socialist hero Jean Jaurès</a> and to three-times prime minister Léon Blum have buoyed voters yearning for lyricism, or a dose of nostalgia. And there is no doubt that Mélenchon wants Le Pen to be defeated.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d3f78124a758506a62baa88c0d8f7b56f174053\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d3f78124a758506a62baa88c0d8f7b56f174053/85_287_3238_1942/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jean-Luc Mélenchon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Jean-Luc Mélenchon casts himself as a hero of the people, a single, homogeneous entity, set against the establishment.

Consider <a href=\"http://www.francetvinfo.fr/politique/melenchon/melenchon-contre-l-allemagne-en-quatre-actes_767759.html\" title=\"\">his anti-German narrative</a>. In a tense country like today’s France, old antagonisms can quickly be reactivated. In his 2015 book Bismarck’s Herring (The German Poison), Mélenchon wrote that “Germany is again a danger”, its “imperialism” is “returning”, and the EU is its “new empire”.</p> <p>He’s described Germans as “grumbling Teutons” who seek to “deport” their old people to eastern Europe or Thailand. And he’s written that German “expansionism” was at work in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/02/german-reunification-25-years-on-how-different-are-east-and-west-really\" title=\"\">country’s 1990 reunification</a> – an “annexation” of East Germany, in his words. That in itself is no small rewriting of history, and no small denial of a people’s freely expressed will after the fall of communism.</p> <p>His criticism of Angela Merkel’s eurozone policies goes far beyond the economic. It peddles nationalistic, if not bigoted, hatreds. He may have tried to soften that impression by saying he wants “the peoples of Europe” to revolt against their governments – and not start to fight among themselves. But he has hardly backtracked on any of his earlier statements. Much of this echoes and amplifies Le Pen’s rhetoric, rather than helping to combat it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bec6443e39bd24371fea795e1c9b486b44e2995f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bec6443e39bd24371fea795e1c9b486b44e2995f/0_135_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marine Le Pen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Mélenchon’s criticism of Angela Merkel’s eurozone policies echoes and amplifies the rhetoric of Marine Le Pen (left) rather than helping to combat it.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Claude Paris/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Which brings us back to Putin: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/24/vladimir-putin-hosts-marine-le-pen-in-moscow\" title=\"\">a hero of Le Pen’s Front National</a> and a constant focus of Merkel’s concerns over the future of the continent. Mélenchon has no particular liking for Putin’s autocracy (although in 2015 he preferred to criticise Boris Nemtsov, an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/02/boris-nemtsov-never-know-who-killed-moscow-vladimir-putin-russian-opposition\" title=\"\">opposition figure assassinated that year in Moscow</a>, rather than blame Putin for anything). But what is most striking about the far-left leader is how he’s systematically refrained from ascribing any responsibility to Russia over the war in Ukraine and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/22/annexing-crimea-putin-make-russia-great-again\" title=\"\">annexation of Crimea</a>, not to mention the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/04/syria-chemical-attack-idlib-province\" title=\"\">killing fields of Syria</a>. Only the west is ever held guilty for anything. This hasn’t changed, even after chemical weapons were used this month and Russia vetoed a UN-sponsored investigation into the crime.</p> <p>Mélenchon’s rallying cry of “peace” on Earth sounds laudable, but his success would have severe consequences for Europe. Pulling France out of Nato and out of EU treaties, which he wants, would unravel Europe’s architecture. It would mean a leap into the unknown, not unlike that advocated by Le Pen.

Consider <a href=\"http://www.francetvinfo.fr/politique/melenchon/melenchon-contre-l-allemagne-en-quatre-actes_767759.html\" title=\"\">his anti-German narrative</a>. In a tense country like today’s France, old antagonisms can quickly be reactivated. In his 2015 book Bismarck’s Herring (The German Poison), Mélenchon wrote that “Germany is again a danger”, its “imperialism” is “returning”, and the EU is its “new empire”.</p> <p>He’s described Germans as “grumbling Teutons” who seek to “deport” their old people to eastern Europe or Thailand. And he’s written that German “expansionism” was at work in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/02/german-reunification-25-years-on-how-different-are-east-and-west-really\" title=\"\">country’s 1990 reunification</a> – an “annexation” of East Germany, in his words. That in itself is no small rewriting of history, and no small denial of a people’s freely expressed will after the fall of communism.</p> <p>His criticism of Angela Merkel’s eurozone policies goes far beyond the economic. It peddles nationalistic, if not bigoted, hatreds. He may have tried to soften that impression by saying he wants “the peoples of Europe” to revolt against their governments – and not start to fight among themselves. But he has hardly backtracked on any of his earlier statements. Much of this echoes and amplifies Le Pen’s rhetoric, rather than helping to combat it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bec6443e39bd24371fea795e1c9b486b44e2995f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bec6443e39bd24371fea795e1c9b486b44e2995f/0_135_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marine Le Pen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Mélenchon’s criticism of Angela Merkel’s eurozone policies echoes and amplifies the rhetoric of Marine Le Pen (left) rather than helping to combat it.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Claude Paris/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Which brings us back to Putin: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/24/vladimir-putin-hosts-marine-le-pen-in-moscow\" title=\"\">a hero of Le Pen’s Front National</a> and a constant focus of Merkel’s concerns over the future of the continent. Mélenchon has no particular liking for Putin’s autocracy (although in 2015 he preferred to criticise Boris Nemtsov, an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/02/boris-nemtsov-never-know-who-killed-moscow-vladimir-putin-russian-opposition\" title=\"\">opposition figure assassinated that year in Moscow</a>, rather than blame Putin for anything). But what is most striking about the far-left leader is how he’s systematically refrained from ascribing any responsibility to Russia over the war in Ukraine and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/22/annexing-crimea-putin-make-russia-great-again\" title=\"\">annexation of Crimea</a>, not to mention the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/04/syria-chemical-attack-idlib-province\" title=\"\">killing fields of Syria</a>. Only the west is ever held guilty for anything. This hasn’t changed, even after chemical weapons were used this month and Russia vetoed a UN-sponsored investigation into the crime.</p> <p>Mélenchon’s rallying cry of “peace” on Earth sounds laudable, but his success would have severe consequences for Europe. Pulling France out of Nato and out of EU treaties, which he wants, would unravel Europe’s architecture. It would mean a leap into the unknown, not unlike that advocated by Le Pen. His radical economic policies would kill any hope of reforming eurozone governance.

That in itself is no small rewriting of history, and no small denial of a people’s freely expressed will after the fall of communism. His criticism of Angela Merkel’s eurozone policies goes far beyond the economic. It peddles nationalistic, if not bigoted, hatreds. He may have tried to soften that impression by saying he wants “the peoples of Europe” to revolt against their governments – and not start to fight among themselves. But he has hardly backtracked on any of his earlier statements. Much of this echoes and amplifies Le Pen’s rhetoric, rather than helping to combat it.\nWhich brings us back to Putin: a hero of Le Pen’s Front National and a constant focus of Merkel’s concerns over the future of the continent. Mélenchon has no particular liking for Putin’s autocracy (although in 2015 he preferred to criticise Boris Nemtsov, an opposition figure assassinated that year in Moscow, rather than blame Putin for anything). But what is most striking about the far-left leader is how he’s systematically refrained from ascribing any responsibility to Russia over the war in Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea, not to mention the killing fields of Syria. Only the west is ever held guilty for anything. This hasn’t changed, even after chemical weapons were used this month and Russia vetoed a UN-sponsored investigation into the crime. Mélenchon’s rallying cry of “peace” on Earth sounds laudable, but his success would have severe consequences for Europe. Pulling France out of Nato and out of EU treaties, which he wants, would unravel Europe’s architecture. It would mean a leap into the unknown, not unlike that advocated by Le Pen. His radical economic policies would kill any hope of reforming eurozone governance. Meanwhile, his vision of international relations – in which Russia’s revisionism over European borders and the Syrian dictator’s mass killing of his own citizens hardly get a mention, whereas western democracies are constantly critiqued – smacks of moral confusion, and much worse. Nor is Mélenchon as refugee-friendly as some would like to think. He’s suggested that he’d prefer to see “10,000 doctors” settle in France rather than a wave of huddled masses. “I’ve never been in favour of freedom of arrival,” he’s said. He’s also on record accusing some foreign workers of “stealing their bread” from French workers. There is much more of Italy’s firebrand populist Beppe Grillo about him than Spain’s Podemos.\nAs the rightwing press dubs him France’s “would-be Chávez”, his charisma protects him. But charisma cannot address so many worrying traits. Hankering for a “citizens’ uprising” and questioning the institutions is one thing, but Mélenchon’s politics arrive laden with baggage that can’t easily be discarded. Victor Hugo’s observation that misery brings people to revolution, and revolution in turn brings them back to it, is well worth remembering as France prepares to vote. A choice between Le Pen and Mélenchon in the presidential run-off on 7 May would likely lead to record low turnout and unprecedented gains for the far right. Those who admire from afar should keep that in mind. And those tempted to follow Mélenchon’s route towards the crumbling of the “old order” need to be careful what they wish for.",

His fiery rhetoric in speeches and savvy, quickfire remarks in recent television debates have helped his numbers surge. One of his slogans is “<em>degagisme</em>”, which can translate as “kick them out” – targeting the rest of the political class. He likes to quote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/feb/12/robespierre-revolutionary-peter-mcphee-review\" title=\"\">Maximilien Robespierre</a> and Victor Hugo.

Mélenchon has no particular liking for Putin’s autocracy (although in 2015 he preferred to criticise Boris Nemtsov, an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/02/boris-nemtsov-never-know-who-killed-moscow-vladimir-putin-russian-opposition\" title=\"\">opposition figure assassinated that year in Moscow</a>, rather than blame Putin for anything). But what is most striking about the far-left leader is how he’s systematically refrained from ascribing any responsibility to Russia over the war in Ukraine and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/22/annexing-crimea-putin-make-russia-great-again\" title=\"\">annexation of Crimea</a>, not to mention the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/04/syria-chemical-attack-idlib-province\" title=\"\">killing fields of Syria</a>. Only the west is ever held guilty for anything. This hasn’t changed, even after chemical weapons were used this month and Russia vetoed a UN-sponsored investigation into the crime.</p> \n<p>Mélenchon’s rallying cry of “peace” on Earth sounds laudable, but his success would have severe consequences for Europe. Pulling France out of Nato and out of EU treaties, which he wants, would unravel Europe’s architecture. It would mean a leap into the unknown, not unlike that advocated by Le Pen. His radical economic policies would kill any hope of reforming eurozone governance. Meanwhile, his vision of international relations – in which Russia’s revisionism over European borders and the Syrian dictator’s mass killing of his own citizens hardly get a mention, whereas western democracies are constantly critiqued – smacks of moral confusion, and much worse.</p> \n<p>Nor is Mélenchon as refugee-friendly as some would like to think. He’s suggested that he’d prefer to see “10,000 doctors” settle in France rather than a wave of huddled masses. <a href=\"http://www.liberation.fr/france/2016/09/08/immigration-melenchon-en-mots-troubles_1490156\" title=\"\">“I’ve never been in favour of freedom of arrival,” he’s said</a>.

But Putin has not sprung from nowhere. He is popular in Russia largely because he is an effective leader of a country that views itself as a great power. He has stood up for its status, honour and self-reliance in the modern world. In doing so he is continuing a tradition that goes back not just to the Soviet leaders but to the tsars.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/31/putinism-russia-1989-world-order-rejected\">Russia’s 1989 plea for a new world order was rejected, and so Putinism was born | Richard Sakwa</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Like all peoples in a crisis – including the British – Russians value a leader who can maintain both internal order and external security. We often forget that for the past 30 years Russia has been going through a prolonged and serious crisis in which both internal order and external security were vulnerable. The breakdown of the Soviet Union in 1991 created an emergency in which parts of the state broke away and serious conflicts erupted within Russia itself. In 1993 it was on the brink of civil war.</p> <p>In the early 1990s Russia tried to create a western-style democracy and free market, and to entrust its fate to international institutions dominated by the west (the UN, IMF etc). This turned out disastrously: the freewheeling economy soon fell victim to corrupt “oligarchs”, and ordinary Russians lost much of their material security. For many, “democracy” meant continual instability and grinding poverty.</p> <p>The country emerged as an impoverished and gravely weakened state, whose military alliance, the Warsaw Pact, had dissolved, while the rival alliance, Nato, not only survived but expanded eastwards to claim former Warsaw Pact members. In 1999 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2009/mar/20/nato-serbia-anniversary\" title=\"\">Nato bombed Serbia</a> without UN authorisation to prevent genocide against the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo. Russians regarded this as both a violation of international law and an encroachment on their traditional sphere of influence. Then followed the US-British invasion of Iraq, again without a full UN mandate. Russia’s alienation reached a climax with Nato’s expansion into the former Soviet Baltic republics and its announcement that it was preparing to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/apr/01/nato.georgia\" title=\"\">invite Ukraine and Georgia to join</a>.</p> <p>The cumulative effect of all these western steps was to provoke Putin into a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/feb/12/usa.russia\" title=\"\">frank diplomatic attack</a> on the US at the Munich security conference of February 2007. “Nato expansion,” he declared, “represents a serious provocation that reduces the level of mutual trust.” The US, he added, had tried to create a “unipolar” world, in which its own interests overruled international law and agreements. “This is extremely dangerous. As a result no one feels safe. I want to emphasise this – no one feels safe.”</p> <p>Putin took action accordingly. In March 2014, in reaction to what he perceived as a western-backed coup in Ukraine, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/28/russia-crimea-white-house\" title=\"\">Russia occupied Crimea</a>, Ukrainian territory that’s home to the Russian Black Sea fleet. This was a gross breach of international law. When I asked a Russian diplomat about it, he agreed that it was, but added: “It is also a breach of the American monopoly on breaking international law.”</p> <p>By then a basic conflict had become apparent between Russia and the western powers in their outlook on international affairs. Putin, like many Russians, had come to feel that international institutions could not guarantee their security, and that therefore they were back in a 19th-century world of great nations contesting power and wealth with one another.</p> <p>Thus, Russia returned to a familiar tsarist geopolitical and military posture, believing that all great nations achieve security through the creation and assertion of raw power. In this view, one side’s gain is the other side’s loss. Win-win situations are not envisaged. It follows that the state has the right and duty to mobilise all the resources of society. The economy, culture, the media, science and technology are all regarded as belonging to the state, to be deployed in this rivalry between great powers. This is what Putin means when he talks of “sovereign democracy” and “information security”.</p> <p>From Peter the Great in the early 18th century to Nicholas II at the beginning of the 20th, the tsars mobilised their military might, their diplomatic skill and their intelligence services to create and maintain their “great power” status among an unstable cluster of rival European powers, notably Britain, France, the Habsburg empire and Prussia. Thus Alexander I defeated Napoleon in 1812 because Russia excelled in all three branches of government. Putin is trying to ensure that today’s Russia performs just as well in all of them.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/25/putin-new-russian-empire-ukraine\">Putin’s desire for a new Russian empire won’t stop with Ukraine | Pavlo Klimkin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But unlike the tsars, Putin has added an ideological element – Russia’s version of soft power. In alliance with the Orthodox church, Russian official propaganda lambasts multiculturalism, gay marriage and mass immigration, and claims to stand up for the family and traditional values against a decadent west that has lost its way and has tried to corrupt Russia. This viewpoint has found a strong echo in the west as well, as a reaction against the international financial “oligarchs” who dominate the global economy: Fidesz in Hungary, the Front National in France, Ukip in Britain and President Trump in the US. There is, if you like, a cold war element here; the Communist International has been replaced by the international alt-right movement. However, this ideological element is mainly instrumental, not dominant, as it was in the cold war years.</p> <p>Putin is not alone in thinking the way he does. Any successor is likely to have similar views. We have to deal with Russia as it is, not spin fantasies about what it would be like without Putin. We need to stand up for what the west is supposed to believe in – free speech, the rule of law, democracy – and defend those interests that are essential to our way of life. Since many Russians also hanker after free speech, the rule of law and democracy, we can afford to be firm on these ideals.</p> <p>We also need to understand, though, why so many Russians feel as they do. They respect adversaries who stand up to them but who are also prepared to talk and to try to reach agreements with them. Combining a robust belief in ourselves with a willingness to take Russia’s problems seriously is a difficult balancing act; but it is a necessary one if we are to take the heat out of a confrontation with Russia that could turn very nasty quite suddenly. We are dealing not just with a recalcitrant Putin but with a major European power that has its own view of the world.</p>"

Yes, we “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hjw4jTG1lyk\">built rockets and a dam across the Yenisei River</a>”, but to buy a sausage you had to stand in line for hours, and we had no choice in our clothes except for size.<br /></p> <p>When the Soviet Union fell, the entire economy collapsed and the ties between the different republics were broken. Under Putin, these links are being restored and new ones made. There is support for small business, farming, science and manufacturing. Russia has started producing quality military equipment. To be respected in the world, you need to demonstrate strength.</p> <p>Putin is popular because when he first became president he was young and energetic after a series of old, sick and degenerate leaders.

In my opinion, you can exert as much influence over the atmosphere inside Russia by voting in elections as you can affect, say, gravity. It’s more effective to surround yourself with people who are prepared to make a step forward and develop new technologies and ways of communication. The political system is just trying to catch up.</p> <p>I don’t watch television, such passive consumption of content doesn’t suit me, and what they show these days is of dubious quality. The internet is a great alternative, and I think most young Russians get their information online.</p> <p> Political marches are not for me; I believe freedom and peace of mind are above all personal matters.

Vladimir Putin’s main achievement is that he has turned out to be a somewhat more capable ruler than his predecessors. There are many myths about Putin, which are mostly the product of Russians’ subconscious impulses. Centuries of peasanthood and then communism created an archetype of the relationship between those in power and the “mob”. The average Russian welcomes the idea of a “harsh but just” ruler.<br /></p> <ul> <li><em>Alina Batischeva has a degree in sociology and was until recently a manager at a coffee shop</em><br /></li> </ul>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2017/mar/23/why-is-russia-still-in-love-with-putin-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/66cm7\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"3316093\"            data-video-name=\"Why is Russia still in love with Putin? – video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58d3aadbe4b01ea2330bb412\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2017/03/23/170322PopularPutin_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2017/03/23/170322PopularPutin.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=12402473&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2017/mar/23/why-is-russia-still-in-love-with-putin-video\">Why is Russia still in love with Putin?</a></figcaption> </figure>   <h2><strong>Alexander Kulevich, 30, Toksovo, near St Petersburg: ‘Putin is independent’</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"dfc1db185982fe5ebfb2328136147656c9ca5940\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dfc1db185982fe5ebfb2328136147656c9ca5940/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Alexander Kulevich\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Compared to the 1990s, Russia is in a much stronger position: it’s not following anyone else’s orders, and its politicians will not be manipulated. Even the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/22/annexing-crimea-putin-make-russia-great-again\">sanctions imposed after the annexation of Crimea</a> have somehow passed us by. By lifting the army and navy from the ruins, Putin is taking his cue from Tsar Alexander III. He is popular because he is independent. Angela Merkel has to consult someone before making a decision but Putin doesn’t need any advisers. I think that’s a good thing.<br /></p> <p>A different issue is that domestic problems are solved only slowly, but here the blame doesn’t lie with Putin but those who just fill their seats. People themselves are not ardently claiming their rights either. They’re still recovering from their Soviet past and the mayhem of the 90s. </p> <ul> <li><em>Alexander Kulevich is a snowboard instructor</em><br /></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Galina Khokhlova, 74, Moscow: ‘Russians can only get rich at someone else’s expense’ </strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a70f4632152d98271af4bdcd887dd579b94a6f31\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a70f4632152d98271af4bdcd887dd579b94a6f31/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Galina Khokhlova\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>As Soviet scientists, my husband and I were given a free three-room apartment in central Moscow. We weren’t rich but lived relatively comfortably. Then came <em>perestroika</em>. It was a catastrophe. The west promised friendship but then Nato expanded into the Baltics. For our own national security, we can’t allow that.<br /></p> <p>Capitalism has brought job insecurity and economic instability, and given power to those who are good at thieving. In Soviet times, whatever the government had left after spending on defence and construction was given to the people. Maybe today’s generation has more opportunities, but back then everyone had the same ones. When some Soviet officials violated that principle, it was frowned upon. Now, there is huge inequality but everyone is indifferent.</p> <p>My children help me financially so I don’t have the life of an average pensioner. But if pensioners widely support the current system it is because they don’t want any more changes. They want stability, even if life is not very comfortable. State handouts such as free transport play a big role in keeping people happy on a daily basis.</p> <p>Those who think we can live the way people in Europe do are naive. Russia’s size and climate mean it takes all our effort just to survive. Here you can only get rich at someone else’s expense.</p> <ul> <li><em>Galina Khoklova is a pensioner, and a former engineer at Russian Academy of Sciences</em><br /></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Alexander Solopin, 26, Yalta, occupied Crimea: ‘Little has changed in the last three years’</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2d5ab43ee53220b83d535142fe465fecd947ecde\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d5ab43ee53220b83d535142fe465fecd947ecde/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Alexander Solopin\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I’ve lived here my entire life. When Crimea became part of Russia [in 2014], I expected local governance would become better, smarter, than under Ukraine. I thought that Russia would help develop Crimea’s infrastructure and industries and turn it into a great place for visitors and locals. But little has changed in the past three years. The authorities continue thieving, just as they used to before. There is no control – if this continues we will never achieve success.<br /></p> <p>Do I think the sanctions are fair? Absolutely not. Ordinary people suffer. Before, we didn’t have enough money to travel abroad. But now we can’t even get a visa. Because the Kerch bridge [connecting Crimea and the Russian mainland] is still unfinished, everything has to come by ferry. That takes time and makes products more expensive, while wages are low. There should be some regulation on prices, but there isn’t at the moment. One wants to hope that all this will end soon and we can start living normal lives.</p> <p>Nevertheless, we made our choice. Whether right or wrong, it’s what we decided.</p> <ul> <li><em>Alexander Solopin is a senior bus mechanic</em><br /></li> </ul>"

                    "bodyTextSummary": "This year marks the centenary of the popular uprising that led to the fall of the Romanov dynasty and the establishment of the Bolshevik regime under the slogan: “Peace, Bread and Land.” One hundred years on, we asked six Russians from across the country about their lives, the Kremlin, Vladimir Putin and Russia’s place in the world. Aigul Valeyeva, 49, Ufa: ‘He’s in good shape and relatively open’\nI was born and came of age in the Soviet Union. At that point our country was a vast union of republics, with different living standards and other factors that the authorities tried to reduce to a single norm. Yes, we “built rockets and a dam across the Yenisei River”, but to buy a sausage you had to stand in line for hours, and we had no choice in our clothes except for size. When the Soviet Union fell, the entire economy collapsed and the ties between the different republics were broken. Under Putin, these links are being restored and new ones made. There is support for small business, farming, science and manufacturing. Russia has started producing quality military equipment. To be respected in the world, you need to demonstrate strength. Putin is popular because when he first became president he was young and energetic after a series of old, sick and degenerate leaders. He knows how to communicate, how to make demands. He’s also in good shape and relatively open. Aigul Valeyeva is a metals researcher at Russian Academy of Sciences Ilya Antyuhov, 30, Moscow: ‘The political system is inert’\nThe political system in Russia is so inert that participating in it nowadays is rather boring. In my opinion, you can exert as much influence over the atmosphere inside Russia by voting in elections as you can affect, say, gravity. It’s more effective to surround yourself with people who are prepared to make a step forward and develop new technologies and ways of communication. The political system is just trying to catch up. I don’t watch television, such passive consumption of content doesn’t suit me, and what they show these days is of dubious quality. The internet is a great alternative, and I think most young Russians get their information online. Political marches are not for me; I believe freedom and peace of mind are above all personal matters. On the other hand, article 31 of the Russian constitution says that citizens have the right to peaceful and unarmed gatherings. A calming walk outside in the fresh air is always healthy ... Ilya Antyuhov is a programmer Alina Batishcheva, 29, Balakovo: ‘There are many myths about Putin’ I think Russia never really lost its greatness, despite going through complicated economic and political times, the aftershocks of which we are still feeling today. Vladimir Putin’s main achievement is that he has turned out to be a somewhat more capable ruler than his predecessors. There are many myths about Putin, which are mostly the product of Russians’ subconscious impulses.

Vladimir Putin’s main achievement is that he has turned out to be a somewhat more capable ruler than his predecessors. There are many myths about Putin, which are mostly the product of Russians’ subconscious impulses. Centuries of peasanthood and then communism created an archetype of the relationship between those in power and the “mob”. The average Russian welcomes the idea of a “harsh but just” ruler.<br /></p> \n<ul> \n <li><em>Alina Batischeva has a degree in sociology and was until recently a manager at a coffee shop</em><br /></li> \n</ul>"

In Soviet times, whatever the government had left after spending on defence and construction was given to the people. Maybe today’s generation has more opportunities, but back then everyone had the same ones. When some Soviet officials violated that principle, it was frowned upon. Now, there is huge inequality but everyone is indifferent.</p> \n<p>My children help me financially so I don’t have the life of an average pensioner. But if pensioners widely support the current system it is because they don’t want any more changes. They want stability, even if life is not very comfortable. State handouts such as free transport play a big role in keeping people happy on a daily basis.</p> \n<p>Those who think we can live the way people in Europe do are naive.

I thought that Russia would help develop Crimea’s infrastructure and industries and turn it into a great place for visitors and locals. But little has changed in the past three years.

Absolutely not. Ordinary people suffer. Before, we didn’t have enough money to travel abroad. But now we can’t even get a visa. Because the Kerch bridge [connecting Crimea and the Russian mainland] is still unfinished, everything has to come by ferry. That takes time and makes products more expensive, while wages are low. There should be some regulation on prices, but there isn’t at the moment.
